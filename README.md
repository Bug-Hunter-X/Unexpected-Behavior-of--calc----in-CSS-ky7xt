# Unexpected Behavior of `calc()` in CSS
This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error related to the use of the `calc()` function in CSS, specifically when dealing with flexbox containers.

## The Bug
The `bug.css` file contains CSS code that uses the `calc()` function to dynamically calculate the width of an element.  In certain contexts (specifically, within a flexbox container), this calculation can produce unexpected results due to the implicit widths of the parent container.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.css` file provides a corrected version of the CSS, addressing the issues identified in the bug report.  The solution highlights best practices for using `calc()` within complex layout scenarios.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` (which is not included in this JSON but needs to be created, containing simple HTML to test this CSS) file in your web browser.
3. Observe the layout and compare it with the expected behavior.
